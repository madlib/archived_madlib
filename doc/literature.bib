	Abstract = {{Several new methods are presented for selecting n records at random without replacement from a file containing N records. Each algorithm selects the records for the sample in a sequential manner---in the same order the records appear in the file. The algorithms are online in that the records for the sample are selected iteratively with no preprocessing. The algorithms require a constant amount of space and are short and easy to implement. The main result of this paper is the design and analysis of Algorithm D, which does the sampling in O(n) time, on the average; roughly n uniform random variates are generated, and approximately n exponentiation operations (of the form ab, for real numbers a and b) are performed during the sampling. This solves an open problem in the literature. CPU timings on a large mainframe computer indicate that Algorithm D is significantly faster than the sampling algorithms in use today.}},

The main result of the paper is the design and analysis of Algorithm Z; it does the sampling in one pass using constant space and in O(n(1 + log(N/n))) expected time, which is optimum, up to a constant factor. Several optimizations are studied that collectively improve the speed of the naive version of the algorithm by an order of magnitude. We give an efficient Pascal-like implementation that incorporates these modifications and that is suitable for general use. Theoretical and empirical results indicate that Algorithm Z outperforms current methods by a significant margin.}},

	Abstract = {{The k-means algorithm is a well-known method for partitioning n points that lie in the d-dimensional space into k clusters. Its main features are simplicity and speed in practice. Theoretically, however, the best known upper bound on its running time (i.e. O(nkd)) is, in general, exponential in the number of points (when kd=\Omega(n log n)). Recently, Arthur and Vassilvitskii [2] showed a super-polynomial worst-case analysis, improving the best known lower bound from \Omega(n) to 2\Omega(\sqrt{n}) with a construction in d=\Omega(\sqrt{n}) dimensions. In [2] they also conjectured the existence of super-polynomial lower bounds for any d>=2. Our contribution is twofold: we prove this conjecture and we improve the lower bound, by presenting a simple construction in the plane that leads to the exponential lower bound 2^\Omega(n).}},

	Abstract = {{The k-means method is one of the most widely used clustering algorithms, drawing its popularity from its speed in practice. Recently, however, it was shown to have exponential worst-case running time. In order to close the gap between practical performance and theoretical analysis, the k-means method has been studied in the model of smoothed analysis. But even the smoothed analyses so far are unsatisfactory as the bounds are still super-polynomial in the number n of data points. 
In this paper, we settle the smoothed running time of the k-means method. We show that the smoothed number of iterations is bounded by a polynomial in n and 1/\sigma, where \sigma is the standard deviation of the Gaussian perturbations. This means that if an arbitrary input data set is randomly perturbed, then the k-means method will run in expected polynomial time on that input set.}},

	Abstract = {{It has long been realized that in pulse-code modulation (PCM), with a given ensemble of signals to handle, the quantum values should be spaced more closely in the voltage regions where the signal amplitude is more likely to fall. It has been shown by Panter and Dite that, in the limit as the number of quanta becomes infinite, the asymptotic fractional density of quanta per unit voltage should vary as the one-third power of the probability density per unit voltage of signal amplitudes. In this paper the corresponding result for any finite number of quanta is derived; that is, necessary conditions are found that the quanta and associated quantization intervals of an optimum finite quantization scheme must satisfy. The optimization criterion used is that the average quantization noise power be a minimum. It is shown that the result obtained here goes over into the Panter and Dite result as the number of quanta become large. The optimum quautization schemes for2^{b}quanta,b=1,2, cdots, 7, are given numerically for Gaussian and for Laplacian distribution of signal amplitudes.}},
