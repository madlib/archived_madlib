\chapter[Linear-chain conditional random field]{Linear-chain conditional random field}
% Motivation. Why do we want to have this abstract layer?
Conditional random fields(CRFs) is a type of discriminative undirected probabilistic graphical model.
CRFs have achieved the start of art accuracy in some real work natural language processing tasks such
as part of speech tagging(POS) and named entity resolution(NER). POS is the process of assigning a part
of speech to each token in a sentence. POS is often used in information retrieval, text to speech.

\section{Introduction}
% Problem definition. What are the problems that we can solve, formally and example applications?
% linearly separable, unconstrained, continuous, deterministic, convex, minimization problems.
This section is to first explain, formally, the type of problems that we consider in the MADlib convex programming framework, and then give a few example modules.

\subsection{Formulation}
Conditional random fields(CRFs) is a type of discriminative undirected probabilistic graphical model.
A linear-chain CRF is a distribution
    p(\boldsymbol Y | \boldsymbol X) = \frac{\exp{\sum_{m=1}^M \lambda_m f_m(y_n,y_{n-1},x_n)}}{Z(X)}

Where Z(X) is an instance specific normalizer
Z(X) = \sum_{y} \exp{\sum_{m=1}^M \lambda_m f_m(y_n,y_{n-1},x_n)}.

Train a CRF by maximizing the log-likelihood of a giving training set \f$ T=\{(x_k,y_k)\}_{k=1}^N \f$.
Seek the zero of the gradient.\\
    \ell_{\lambda}=\sum_k \log p_\lambda(y_k|x_k) =\sum_k[\lambda F(y_k,x_k)-\log Z_\lambda(x_k)]\\
    \nabla \ell_{\lambda}=\sum_k[\lambda F(y_k,x_k)-E_{p\lambda(Y|x_k)}F(Y,x_k)]

To avoid overfitting, we penalize the likelihood with a spherical Gaussian weight prior:\\
    \ell_{\lambda}^\prime=\sum_k[\lambda F(y_k,x_k)-\log Z_\lambda(x_k)]-\frac{\lVert \lambda \rVert^2}{2\sigma ^2}\\
    \nabla \ell_{\lambda}^\prime=\sum_k[\lambda F(y_k,x_k)-E_{p\lambda(Y|x_k)}F(Y,x_k)]-\frac{\lambda}{\sigma ^2}

\section{Part of Speech Tagging}
Part-of-speech tagging,also called grammatical tagging or word-category disambiguation, is the process of assigning 
a part of speech to each word in a sentence. There are two distinct methods for POS task: rule-based and stochastic.
In rule-based method, it defines large collection of rules to indentify the tag. Stochastic method is based on probabilistic 
graphic models such as hidden markov models, conditional random fields. In practice, condtional random files has been approved 
to achieve the state of art of accuracy.
\subsection{Tag Set}
There are various tag set used in the literature. The Pennsylvania Treebank tag-set is the commonly used tag set used. It contains
45 tags. The following list part of tags in the tag set.
\begin{tabular}{lll||lll}
  Tag & Description         & Example       & Tag & Description         & Example\\
  \hline                        
  CC  & Coordin,Conjunction & and,but,or    & SYM & Symbol              & +,\%,\&\\
  CD  & Cardinal number     & one,two,three & TO  & 'to'                & to\\
  DT  & Determiner          & a,the         & UH  & Interjection        & ah,oops\\
  EX  & Existential         & there         & VB  & Verb,base form      & eat\\
  ... & ...                 & ...           & ... & ...                 & ...\\

  RBS & Adverb,superlative  & fastest       & :   & Mid-sentence punc   & (:;...-)\\
  RP  & Particle            & up,off        &     &                     &\\
  \hline  
\end{tabular}

\section{Feature Extraction}
The Feature Extraction module provides functionality for basic text-analysis
tasks such as part-of-speech (POS) tagging and named-entity resolution.
At present, six feature types are implemented.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Edge Feature: transition feature that encodes the transition feature weight from current label to next label.
    \item Start Feature: fired when the current token is the first token in a sentence.
    \item End Feature: fired when the current token is the last token in a sentence.
    \item Word Feature: fired when the current token is observed in the trained dictionary.
    \item Unknown Feature: fired when the current token is not observed in the trained dictionary for at least certain times.
    \item Regex Feature: fired when the current token can be matched by the regular expression.
    \end{itemize}

Advantage of extracting features using SQL statements:
\begin{itemize}
\item decoupling the feature extraction and convex solver.
\item compared with procedure language, SQL is much more easier to understand.
\item store all the features in tables which avoids the recomputing the features over iterations.Also boost the performance.
\item SQL is naivelly paralleled
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Training Data Feature Extraction}
for each document it has feature item
sparse r feautre(single state feature) \\
(prev_label, label, f_index, start_pos, exist)
prev_label:it is a single state feature, prev_label is always 0. 
label: the label of the single state feature
f_index: the index of the feature in the feature table
start_pos: the postion of the token in a sentence which has this feature
exist: indicate whether the token exist or not in the acutal training data set\\

dense m feature\\
(prev_label, label, f_index, start_pos, exist)
prev_label:it is a single state feature, prev_label is always 0. 
label: the label of the single state feature
f_index: the index of the feature in the feature table
start_pos: the postion of the token in a sentence which has this feature
exist: indicate whether the token exist or not in the acutal training data set\\

sparse m feature\\
(f_index, prev_label, label)
f_index: the index of current feature
prev_label: the label of previous token 
label: the label of current token

For performance consideraton, we split the m feature to dense_m feature and spare m feature\\

\subsection{Testing Data Feature Extraction}
  This feature extraction function will produce two factor tables, "m table"
  $viterbi\_mtbl$ and "r table" $viterbi\_rtbl$. The $viterbi\_mtbl$
  table and a $viterbi\_rtbl$ table are used to calculate the best label
  sequence for each sentence.
 
  $viterbi\_mtbl$ table
  encodes the edge features which are solely dependent on upon current label and
  previous y value. The m table has three columns which are prev\_label, label,
  and value respectively.
  If the number of labels in \f$ n \f$, then the m factor table will \f$ n^2 \f$
  rows. Each row encodes the transition feature weight value from the previous label
  to the current label.
 
  startFeature is considered as a special edge feature which is from the
  beginning to the first token. Likewise, endFeature can be considered
  as a special edge feature which is from the last token to the very end.
  So m table encodes the edgeFeature, startFeature, and endFeature.
  If the total number of labels in the label space is 45 from 0 to 44,
  then the m factor array is as follows:
  \begin{tabular}{l*{6}{c}r}
   token             & 0   & 1   & 2   & 3   & ... & 43 &  44 \\
   \hline
  -1                 & 2.1 & 1.1 & 1.0 & 1.1 & 1.1 & 2.1 & 1.1  \\
   0                 & 1.1 & 3.9 & 1.2 & 2.1 & 2.8 & 1.8 & 0.8  \\
   1                 & 0.7 & 1.7 & 2.9 & 3.8 & 0.6 & 3.2 & 0.2  \\
   2                 & 0.2 & 3.2 & 3.8 & 2.9 & 0.2 & 0.1 & 0.2  \\
   3                 & 1.2 & 6.9 & 7.8 & 8.0 & 0.1 & 1.9 & 1.7  \\
   ...               & ... & ... & ... & ... & ... & ... & ...  \\
   44                & 8.2 & 1.8 & 3.7 & 2.1 & 7.2 & 1.3 & 7.2  \\
   45                & 1.8 & 7.8 & 5.6 & 9.8 & 2.3 & 9.4 & 1.1  \\
  \end{tabular}
 
  $viterbi\_r$ table
  is related to specific tokens. It encodes the single state features,
  e.g., wordFeature, RegexFeature for all tokens. The r table is represented
  in the following way.\\
  \begin{tabular}{l*{6}{c}r}
   token             & 0   & 1   & 2   & 3   & ... & 43 &  44 \\
   \hline
   madlib            & 0.2 & 4.1 & 0.0 & 2.1 & 0.1 & 2.5 & 1.2  \\
   is                & 1.3 & 3.0 & 0.2 & 3.1 & 0.8 & 1.9 & 0.9  \\
   an                & 0.9 & 1.1 & 1.9 & 3.8 & 0.7 & 3.8 & 0.7  \\
   open-source       & 0.8 & 0.2 & 1.8 & 2.7 & 0.5 & 0.8 & 0.1  \\
   library           & 1.8 & 1.9 & 1.8 & 8.7 & 0.2 & 1.8 & 1.1  \\
   ...               & ... & ... & ... & ... & ... & ... & ...  \\
  \end{tabular}

\section{Linear-chain CRF Learning}

\subsection{Forward-backward Algorithm}
$E_{p\lambda(Y|x)}F(Y,x)$ is computed using a variant of the forward-backward algorithm:

    E_{p\lambda(Y|x)}F(Y,x) = \sum_y p\lambda(y|x)F(y,x)
                            = \sum_i\frac{\alpha_{i-1}(f_i*M_i)\beta_i^T}{Z_\lambda(x)}\\
    $Z_\lambda(x) = \alpha_n.1^T$ \\
    where $\alpha_i$ and $\lambda_i$ the forward and backward state cost vectors defined by\\
    \alpha_i = 
    \begin{cases}
    \alpha_{i-1}M_i, & 0<i<=n\\
    1, & i=0
    \end{cases}
    ,
    \beta_i^T = 
    \begin{cases}
    M_{i+1}\lambda_{i+1}^T, & 1<=i<n\\
    1, & i=n
    \end{cases}
\subsection{L-BFGS Convex Solver}
The limited-memory BFGS(L-BFGS) is the limited memory variation of the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno(BFGS).
It is the state of art of large scale non-constraint convex optimization method.
We translate a in-memory java implementation to a c++ in-database implementation with Eigen support.
Eigen vector and Eigen matrix are used instead of the plain one dimentional and two dimentional arrays.
In the java in-memeory implementation, it defines many static variables which are shared between the interations.
However, in the MADlib implementation, we define these variables in the state object.
initialize one LBFGS interation using the current variables in the state object $LBFGS instance(state)$
At the end of one iteration, we need to save the variables to the the state using $instance.save\_state(state)$

\section{Viterbi Inference}
The Viterbi algorithm is the popular algorithm to find the top-k most likely labelingsof a document for CRF models. 
We chose to implement a Python UDF that uses iterations to drive the Viterbi inference. Each iteration will finish the inference over one document.
In Greenplum, Viterbi can be run in parallel over different subsets of the document on a multi-core machine.
\[
V(i,y) =
\begin{cases}
 \max_{y^\prime}(V(i-1,y^\prime)) + \textstyle \sum_{k=1}^K \lambda_kf_k(y,y^\prime,x_i), & \text{if } i\ge0 \\
 0, & \text{if } i=-1.
\end{cases}
\]
