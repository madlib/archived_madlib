\chapter[Linear-chain Conditional Random Field]{Linear-chain Conditional Random Field}
% Motivation. Why do we want to have this abstract layer?
Conditional random field(CRFs) is a type of discriminative undirected probabilistic graphical model.
Linear-chain CRFs are a special CRFs which assumes that the next state only depends on the current state. 
Linear-chain CRFs achieved the start of art accuracy in some real world natural language processing tasks such
as part of speech tagging(POS) and named entity resolution(NER).

\section{Linear-chain CRF Learning}

\subsection{Mathematical Notations}
\begin{itemize}
\item $p(\boldsymbol Y | \boldsymbol X)$: conditional probability distributions of label sequence $\boldsymbol Y$ given input sequence $\boldsymbol X$.
\item $M$: total number of unique features.
\item $I$: the positon of last token in a training sentence.
\item $N$: number of sentences in the training data set.
\item $\lambda$: the coefficient(feature weight).
\item $\ell_{\lambda}$: log-likelihood summarized over all training sentences.
\item $\nabla \ell_{\lambda}$: gradient vector summarized over all training sentences.
\item $\ell_{\lambda}^\prime$: adjusted log-likelihood to avoid over fitting using spherical Gaussian weight prior.
\item $\nabla \ell_{\lambda}^\prime$: adjusted gradient vector to avoid over fitting using spherical Gaussian weight prior.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Formulation}
Conditional random fields(CRFs) is a type of discriminative undirected probabilistic graphical model.
A linear-chain CRF is a distribution
    \[p(\boldsymbol Y | \boldsymbol X) = \frac{\exp{\sum_{m=1}^M \sum_{i=0}^{I} \lambda_m f_m(y_i,y_{i-1},x_i)}}{Z(X)}\]

Where Z(X) is an instance specific normalizer
\[Z(X) = \sum_{y} \exp{\sum_{m=1}^M \sum_{i=0}^{I} \lambda_m f_m(y_i,y_{i-1},x_i)}\].

Train a CRF by maximizing the log-likelihood of a giving training set $ T=\{(x_k,y_k)\}_{k=1}^N$.
Seek the zero of the gradient.\\
    \[\ell_{\lambda}=\sum_k \log p_\lambda(y_k|x_k) =\sum_k[\lambda F(y_k,x_k)-\log Z_\lambda(x_k)]\]
    \[\nabla \ell_{\lambda}=\sum_k[\lambda F(y_k,x_k)-E_{p\lambda(Y|x_k)}F(Y,x_k)]\]

To avoid overfitting, we penalize the likelihood with a spherical Gaussian weight prior:\\
    \[\ell_{\lambda}^\prime=\sum_k[\lambda F(y_k,x_k)-\log Z_\lambda(x_k)]-\frac{\lVert \lambda \rVert^2}{2\sigma ^2}\]
    \[\nabla \ell_{\lambda}^\prime=\sum_k[\lambda F(y_k,x_k)-E_{p\lambda(Y|x_k)}F(Y,x_k)]-\frac{\lambda}{\sigma ^2}\]
Note:We hard code sigma to $100$ in the implementation which follows other CRF packages in the literature.

\subsection{Forward-backward Algorithm}
$E_{p\lambda(Y|x)}F(Y,x)$ is computed using a variant of the forward-backward algorithm:

    \[E_{p\lambda(Y|x)}F(Y,x) = \sum_y p\lambda(y|x)F(y,x) = \sum_i\frac{\alpha_{i-1}(f_i*M_i)\beta_i^T}{Z_\lambda(x)}\]
    \[$Z_\lambda(x) = \alpha_I.1^T$\]
    where $\alpha_i$ and $\lambda_i$ the forward and backward state cost vectors defined by\\
  \[\alpha_i = 
    \begin{cases}
    \alpha_{i-1}M_i, & 0<i<=n\\
    1, & i=0
    \end{cases}
    ,
    \beta_i^T = 
    \begin{cases}
    M_{i+1}\lambda_{i+1}^T, & 1<=i<I\\
    1, & i=n
    \end{cases}
  \]

\subsection{L-BFGS Convex Solver}
The limited-memory BFGS(L-BFGS) is the limited memory variation of the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno(BFGS).
It is the state of art of large scale non-constraint convex optimization method.
We translate a in-memory java implementation to a c++ in-database implementation with Eigen support.
Eigen vector and Eigen matrix are used instead of the plain one dimentional and two dimentional arrays.
In the java in-memeory implementation, it defines many static variables which are shared between the interations.
However, in the MADlib implementation, we define these variables in the state object.
Before one iteration of L-BFGS optimization, we need to initialize the L-BFGS with current the state object. 
At the end of one iteration, we need to dump the updated variables to the the database state for next iteration.


\subsection{Parallel CRF Training}
\begin{algorithm}[CRF training$(z_{1:M})$] \label{alg:CRF training}
\alginput{Observation set $z_{1:M}$,\\
convergence criterion $\mathit{Convergence}()$,\\
start strategy $\mathit{Start}()$,\\

transition strategy $\mathit{Transition}()$,\\
finalization strategy $\mathit{Finalization}()$}
\algoutput{Coefficients $w \in \mathbb{R}^N$}
\algprecond{$iteration = 0, diag = \boldsymbol 1$}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
	\State $w_\text{new} \set \mathit{Start}(z_{1:M})$
	\Repeat
        \State $w_\text{old} \set w_\text{new}$
        \State $\mathit{state} \set \mathit{Initialization}(w_\text{new})$
		\For{$m \in 1..M$} \Comment{Single entry in the observation set}
			\State $\mathit{state} \set \mathit{Transition}(\mathit{state}, z_m)$
                \Comment{Computing gradient and log-likelihood.}
		\EndFor
		\State $w_\text{new} \set Finalization(\mathit{state})$ \Comment{Mainly invoke L-BFGS convex solver}
	\Until{$Convergence(w_\text{new}, g_\text{new}, \mathit{iteration})$}
    \State \Return $w_\text{new}$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\paragraph{Programming Model.}
We above give the algorithm of parallel CRF training strategy, in the fashion of the selected programming model supported by MADlib (mainly user-defined aggregate).

\paragraph{Parallelism.}
The outer loop is inherently sequential over multiple iterations.
The iteration $n+1$ takes the output of iteration $n$ as input, so on so forth until the stop criterion is satisfied.
The inner loop which calculates the gradient and log-likelihood for each document is data-parallel.
Simple model averaging are used to merge two states.
A merge function is not explicitly added to the pseudocode for simplicity.
The finalization function invokes the L-BFGS convex solver to get a new solution. L-BFGS is sequential, but very fast.
Experiments show that the speed-up ration approaches the number of segments configured in the Greenplum database.

\paragraph{Convergence criterion.}
Usually, following conditions are combined by AND, OR, or NOT.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The norm of gradient divided by the norm of coefficient drops below a given threshold.
    \item The maximum number of iterations has been reached.
    \item There could be more.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Start strategy.}
In most cases, zeros are used unless otherwise specified.

\paragraph{Transition strategies.}
This function contains the logic of computing the gradient and log-likelihood for each tuple using the forward-backward
algorithm. The algorithms will be discussed in the following sections.

\begin{algorithm}[transition-lbfgs$(\mathit{state}, z_m)$] \label{alg:transition-lbfgs}
\alginput{Transition state $\mathit{state}$,\\
observation entry $z_m$,\\
gradient function $\mathit{Gradient}()$}
\algoutput{Transition state $\mathit{state}$}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
    \State $\{state.g,state.loglikelihood\}  \set \mathit{Gradient}(\mathit{state}, z_m)$
        \Comment{using forward-backward algorithm to calculate gradient and loglikelihood}
    \State $\mathit{state}.num\_rows \set \mathit{state}.num\_rows + 1$
    \State \Return $\mathit{state}$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}


\paragraph{Merge strategies.}
The merge function simply sums the gradient and loglikelihood over all training documents 
\begin{algorithm}[merge-lbfgs$(\mathit{state_1}, \mathit{state_2})$] \label{alg:merge-lbfgs}
\alginput{Transition state $\mathit{state_1}$,\\
Transition state $\mathit{state_2}$}
\algoutput{Transition state $\mathit{state_{new}}$}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
    \State $\mathit{state_{new}}.g \set \mathit{state_1}.g + \mathit{state_2}.g$
    \State $\mathit{state_{new}}.loglikelihood \set \mathit{state_1}.loglikelihood + \mathit{state_2}.loglikelihood$
    \State \Return $\mathit{state_{new}}$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}


\paragraph{Finalization strategy.}
The finalization function invokes the L-BFGS convex solver to get a new coefficent vector.\\

\begin{algorithm}[finalization-lbfgs$(state)$] \label{alg:CRF training}
\alginput{Transition state $state$,\\
LBFGS $\mathit{lbfgs}()$}
\algoutput{Transition state  $state$}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
        \State $\{state.g,state.loglikelihood\} \set penalty(state.g,state.loglikelihood)$ \Comment{To avoid overfitting, add penalization} 
        \State $\{state.g,state.loglikelihood\}\set-\{state.g,state.loglikelihood\}$ \Comment{negation for maximization}
        \State LBFGS instance($state)$ \Comment{initialize the L-BFGS instance with previous state}
        \State instance.$lbfgs()$ \Comment{invoke the L-BFGS convex solver}
        \State instance.save\_state$(state)$ \Comment{save updates variables to the state for next iteration}
        \State \Return $state$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

Feeding with current solution, gradient, log-likelihood, etc., the L-BFGS will ouput a new solution.
To avoid overfitting, a penalization function is needed. We choose to penalize the loglikelihood with a spherical Gaussian weight prior.
Also, L-BFGS is to maximum objective, so we need to negate the gradient vector and loglikelihood to fit your needs to minimize the loglikehood.

\section{Linear-chain CRF Applications}
Linear-chain CRF can be used in various applications such as  part of speech tagging and named entity resolution.
All the following section assumes that the application is part of speech tagging. It can be fitted to named entity resolution with minimal effort. 

\subsection{Part of Speech Tagging}
Part-of-speech tagging, also called grammatical tagging or word-category disambiguation, is the process of assigning 
a part of speech to each word in a sentence. POS has been widely used in information retrieval, text to speech. There are two distinct methods for 
POS task: rule-based and stochastic.
In rule-based method, it defines large collection of rules to indentify the tag. Stochastic method is based on probabilistic 
graphic models such as hidden markov models, conditional random fields. In practice, conditional random fields have been approved 
to achieve the state of art of accuracy.
\subsection{Tag Set}
There are various tag set used in the literature. The Pennsylvania Treebank tag-set is the commonly used tag set used. It contains
45 tags. The following list part of tags in the tag set.

\begin {table}
\caption {Pen Treebank III Tag Set} \label{tab:title} 
\[\begin{tabular}{lll||lll}
  Tag & Description         & Example       & Tag & Description         & Example\\
  \hline                        
  CC  & Coordin,Conjunction & and,but,or    & SYM & Symbol              & +,\%,\&\\
  CD  & Cardinal number     & one,two,three & TO  & 'to'                & to\\
  DT  & Determiner          & a,the         & UH  & Interjection        & ah,oops\\
  EX  & Existential         & there         & VB  & Verb,base form      & eat\\
  ... & ...                 & ...           & ... & ...                 & ...\\
  RBR & Adverb,comparative  & faster        & .   & Sentence-final      & (.!?)\\
  RBS & Adverb,superlative  & fastest       & :   & Mid-sentence punc   & (:;...-)\\
  RP  & Particle            & up,off        &     &                     &\\
  \hline  
\end{tabular}\]
\end{table}

\subsection{Regular Expression Table}
  Regex feature is to capture the relationship between the morphology of a token and it's corresponding tag.
For example, a token end with 's' are mostly likely to be plural noun and a token end with 'ly' are more likely to be an
adverb. You can define your own regular expressions to capture the intrinsic characteristics of the given training data.
\begin {table}
\caption {Regular expression table} \label{tab:title} 
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll||ll}
  pattern & name             & pattern & name\\
  \hline                        
  $\wedge[A-Z][a-z]+\$$    & InitCapital       & $\wedge[A-Z]+\$$  & isAllCapital \\
  $\wedge.*[0-9]+.*\$$     & containsDigit     & $\wedge.+[.]\$$   & endsWithDot\\
  $\wedge.+[,]\$$          & endsWithComma     & $\wedge.+er\$$    & endsWithEr\\
  $\wedge.+est\$$	   & endsWithEst       & $\wedge.+ed\$$    & endsWithEd\\
  $\wedge.+s\$$	           & endsWithS         & $\wedge.+ing\$$   & endsWithIng\\
  $\wedge.+ly\$$	   & endsWithly        & $\wedge.+-.+\$$   & isDashSeparatedWords\\
  $\wedge.*@.*\$$	   & isEmailId         &           & \\
  \hline  
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}

\section{Feature Extraction}
The Feature Extraction module provides functionality for basic text-analysis
tasks such as part-of-speech (POS) tagging and named-entity resolution.
At present, six feature types are implemented.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Edge Feature: transition feature that encodes the transition feature weight from current label to next label.
    \item Start Feature: fired when the current token is the first token in a sentence.
    \item End Feature: fired when the current token is the last token in a sentence.
    \item Word Feature: fired when the current token is observed in the trained dictionary.
    \item Unknown Feature: fired when the current token is not observed in the trained dictionary for at least certain times.
    \item Regex Feature: fired when the current token can be matched by the regular expression.
    \end{itemize}

Advantages of extracting features using SQL statements:
\begin{itemize}
\item [$\star$] Decoupling the feature extraction and other code.
\item [$\star$] Compared with procedure language, SQL is much more easier to understand.
\item [$\star$] Store all the features in tables which avoids the recomputing the features over iterations.Also boost the performance.
\item [$\star$] SQL is naivelly paralleled
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Training Data Feature Extraction}
The final input table schema which contains all the feature data for the crf learning algorithm is as follows:
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{ | l | l | l | l |}
    \hline
    doc\_id & sparse\_r & dense\_m & sparse\_m \\ 
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{itemize}

\item 
sparse r feautre(single state feature):(prev\_label, label, f\_index, start\_pos, exist)

\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{ | l | l |}
    \hline
    label & Description \\ \hline
    prev\_label & the label of previous token, it is always 0 in r table.\\ 
    label       & the label of the single state feature\\
    f\_index    & the index of the feature in the feature table\\
    start\_pos  & the postion of the token(starting from 0)\\
    exist       & indicate whether the token exist or not in the acutal training data set\\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

\item 
dense m feature:
(prev\_label, label, f\_index, start\_pos, exist)
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{ | l | l |}
    \hline
    label & Description \\ \hline
    prev\_label & the label of previous token.\\ 
    label       & the label of current token\\
    f\_index    & the index of the feature in the feature table\\
    start\_pos  & the postion of the token in a sentence(starting from 0)\\
    exist       & indicate whether the token exist or not in the acutal training data set\\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

\item 
sparse m feature:(f\_index, prev\_label, label)
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{ | l | l |}
    \hline
    label & Description \\ \hline
    f\_index    &  the index of the feature in the feature table\\
    prev\_label &  the label of previous token \\
    label       &  the label of current token\\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

\end{itemize}
For performance consideraton, we split the m feature to dense\_m feature and spare m feature\\
The acutal spare r table is array union of individal r features ordered by the start positon of tokens.
So the function to compute the gradient vector and loglikelihood can scan the feature arrays from begining to end.

\subsection{Testing Data Feature Extraction}
  This feature extraction function will produce two factor tables, "m table"
  $viterbi\_mtbl$ and "r table" $viterbi\_rtbl$. The $viterbi\_mtbl$
  table and a $viterbi\_rtbl$ table are used to calculate the best label
  sequence for each sentence.

\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{ | l | l | l | l |}
    \hline
    doc\_id & viterbi\_mtbl & viterbi\_rtbl \\ 
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item 
  $viterbi\_mtbl$ table
  encodes the edge features which are solely dependent on upon current label and
  previous y value. The m table has three columns which are prev\_label, label,
  and value respectively.
  If the number of labels in $n$, then the m factor table will $n^2$
  rows. Each row encodes the transition feature weight value from the previous label
  to the current label.
 
  startFeature is considered as a special edge feature which is from the
  beginning to the first token. Likewise, endFeature can be considered
  as a special edge feature which is from the last token to the very end.
  So m table encodes the edgeFeature, startFeature, and endFeature.
  If the total number of labels in the label space is 45 from 0 to 44,
  then the m factor array is as follows:
\begin {table}
\caption {viterbi\_mtbl table} \label{tab:title} 
 
  \[\begin{tabular}{l*{6}{c}r}
   token             & 0   & 1   & 2   & 3   & ... & 43 &  44 \\
   \hline
  -1                 & 2.1 & 1.1 & 1.0 & 1.1 & 1.1 & 2.1 & 1.1  \\
   0                 & 1.1 & 3.9 & 1.2 & 2.1 & 2.8 & 1.8 & 0.8  \\
   1                 & 0.7 & 1.7 & 2.9 & 3.8 & 0.6 & 3.2 & 0.2  \\
   2                 & 0.2 & 3.2 & 3.8 & 2.9 & 0.2 & 0.1 & 0.2  \\
   3                 & 1.2 & 6.9 & 7.8 & 8.0 & 0.1 & 1.9 & 1.7  \\
   ...               & ... & ... & ... & ... & ... & ... & ...  \\
   44                & 8.2 & 1.8 & 3.7 & 2.1 & 7.2 & 1.3 & 7.2  \\
   45                & 1.8 & 7.8 & 5.6 & 9.8 & 2.3 & 9.4 & 1.1  \\
  \end{tabular}\]
\end{table}

  \item 
  $viterbi\_r$ table
  is related to specific tokens. It encodes the single state features,
  e.g., wordFeature, RegexFeature for all tokens. The r table is represented
  in the following way.\\
\begin {table}
\caption {viterbi\_rtbl table} \label{tab:title} 

  \[\begin{tabular}{l*{6}{c}r}
   token             & 0   & 1   & 2   & 3   & ... & 43 &  44 \\
   \hline
   madlib            & 0.2 & 4.1 & 0.0 & 2.1 & 0.1 & 2.5 & 1.2  \\
   is                & 1.3 & 3.0 & 0.2 & 3.1 & 0.8 & 1.9 & 0.9  \\
   an                & 0.9 & 1.1 & 1.9 & 3.8 & 0.7 & 3.8 & 0.7  \\
   open-source       & 0.8 & 0.2 & 1.8 & 2.7 & 0.5 & 0.8 & 0.1  \\
   library           & 1.8 & 1.9 & 1.8 & 8.7 & 0.2 & 1.8 & 1.1  \\
   ...               & ... & ... & ... & ... & ... & ... & ...  \\
  \end{tabular}\]
\end{table}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Learned Model}
The CRF learning algorithm will generate two tables: feature table and dictionary table
Feature table stores all the features and their corresponding feature weight.
The dictionary constains all the tokens and their number of times they appears in the training data.

\section{Linear-chain CRF Inference}
The Viterbi algorithm is the popular algorithm to find the top-k most likely labelings of a document for CRF models. 
We chose to implement a Python UDF that uses iterations to drive the Viterbi inference. Each iteration will finish the inference over one document.
In Greenplum, Viterbi can be run in parallel over different subsets of the document on a multi-core machine.
\[
V(i,y) =
\begin{cases}
 \max_{y^\prime}(V(i-1,y^\prime)) + \textstyle \sum_{k=1}^K \lambda_kf_k(y,y^\prime,x_i), & \text{if } i\ge0 \\
 0, & \text{if } i=-1.
\end{cases}
\]
