Apache MADlib (incubating) is an open-source library for scalable
in-database analytics. It provides data-parallel implementations of
mathematical, statistical and machine learning methods for structured
and unstructured data.

The MADlib mission: to foster widespread development of scalable analytic
skills, by harnessing efforts from commercial practice, academic research,
and open-source development.

    @brief Mathematical operations for arrays and matrices
    @details
These modules provide basic mathematical operations to be run on array and matrices.

For a distributed system, a matrix cannot simply be represented as a 2D array of numbers in memory.
<b>We provide two forms of distributed representation of a matrix</b>:

- Dense: The matrix is represented as a distributed collection of 1-D arrays.
        An example 3x10 matrix would be the below table:
<pre>
 row_id |         row_vec
--------+-------------------------
   1    | {9,6,5,8,5,6,6,3,10,8}
   2    | {8,2,2,6,6,10,2,1,9,9}
   3    | {3,9,9,9,8,6,3,9,5,6}
</pre>
- Sparse: The matrix is represented using the row and column indices for each
non-zero entry of the matrix. Example:
<pre>
 row_id | col_id | value
--------+--------+-------
      1 |      1 |     9
      1 |      5 |     6
      1 |      6 |     6
      2 |      1 |     8
      3 |      1 |     3
      3 |      2 |     9
      4 |      7 |     0
(6 rows)
</pre>
&nbsp;
All matrix operations work with either form of representation.

In many cases, a matrix function can be <b>decomposed to vector operations
applied independently on each row of a matrix (or corresponding rows of two
matrices)</b>. We have also provided access to these internal vector operations
(\ref grp_array) for greater flexibility. Matrix operations like
<em>matrix_add</em> use the corresponding vector operation (<em>array_add</em>)
and also include additional validation and formating. Other functions like
<em>matrix_mult</em> are complex and use a combination of such vector operations
and other SQL operations.

<b>It's important to note</b> that these array functions are only available for the
dense format representation of the matrix. In general, the scope of a single
array function invocation is limited to only an array (1-dimensional or
2-dimensional) that fits in memory. When such function is executed on a table of
arrays, the function is called multiple times - once for each  array (or pair of
arrays). On contrary, scope of a single matrix function invocation  is the
complete matrix stored as a distributed table.
