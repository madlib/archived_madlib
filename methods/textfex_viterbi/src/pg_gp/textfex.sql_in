@about 
This module provides the functionality of feature extraction for basic text analysis tasks such as
part-of-speech(POS) tagging, named entity resolution. In addition to feature extraction, it also 
have a viterbi implemenation to get the best label sequence and the conditional probability 
\f$ p(top1_label_sequence|sentence) \f$.
At present, six feature types are implemented
    - Edge Feature: transition feature that encodes the transition feature weight from current label to next label.
    - Start Feature: fired when the current token is the first token in a sentence.
    - End Feature: fired when the current token is the last token in a sentence.
    - Word Feature: fired when the current token is observed in the trained dictionary. 
    - Unknown Feature: fired when the current token is not observed in the trained dictionary for at least certain times.
    - Regex Feature: fired when the current token can be matched by the regular expression.
you can add your own feature type according to the training model

Instead of scanning every tokens in a sentence and extract features for each token on fly, 
 we extract features for each distinct token and materlized it in the table.
 When we call viterbi function to get the best label sequence, we only need to a single lookup to get the feature weight.

@usage 
  - Use CRF PACKAGE [1] to generate the trained models. Basically CRF PACKAGE generates two model files 'feature' and 'crf'.
    Wrte some simple scripts to convert the data in the model files to the data format required by in this module.

  - Load model from local drive to database 
    <pre>SELECT madlib.load_crf_model(
         '<em>/path/to/data</em>');</pre>

  - Run feature extraction in batch mode or interactive mode
    <pre>SELECT madlib.text_feature_extraction(
         '<em>segmenttbl</em>',
         '<em>dictionary</em>',
         '<em>labeltbl</em>',
         '<em>regextbl</em>',
         '<em>featuretbl</em>',
         '<em>viterbi_mtbl</em>',
         '<em>viterbi_rtbl</em>',
         '<em>mode</em>');</pre>
    if mode equals -1, then the function will do feature extraction for all the sentences in the segmenttbl,
    else it will do feature extraction for the sentence specified by mode.

  - Run viterbi function to get the best label sequence and the conditional probability \f$ p(top1_label_sequence|sentence) \f$.
    <pre>SELECT madlib.vcrf_label(
         '<em>segmenttbl</em>',
         '<em>viterbi_mtbl</em>',
         '<em>viterbi_rtbl</em>',
         '<em>labeltbl</em>',
         '<em>resulttbl</em>',
         '<em>schemaname</em>');</pre>

/**
 * @brief This function extracts text feature. It supports two modes: batch mode and interactive mode.
 * In batch mode, it extracts features for all sentences.
 * In interactive mode, it extracts features for one sentence specified by the docId
 * This feature extraction function will produce two factor tables, m table and r table. 
 * The viterbi_m table and viterbi_r table are used to calucate the best label sequence for each sentence.
 * - viterbi_mtbl table
 * encodes the edge features which are solely dependent on upon current label and previous y value.
 * m table has three colomuns which are prev_label, label, value respectively.
 * if the number of labels in \f$ n \f$, then the m factors table will \f$ n^2 \f$ rows. Each row encodes the transition feature weight 
 * value from previous label to current label.
 * startFeature is can be considered as a special edge feature which is from the very first to the first token
 * endFeature can be considered as a special edge feature which is from the last token to the vey end.
 * so m table encodes the edgeFeature, startFeature, endFeature.
 * if the total number of labels in the label space are 45 from 0 to 44. then the m factors array is as follows:
 * <pre>
 *                  0  1  2  3  4  5...44
 * startFeature -1  a  a  a  a  a  a...a
 * edgeFeature   0  a  a  a  a  a  a...a
 * edgeFeature   1  a  a  a  a  a  a...a
 * ...
 * edgeFeature  44  a  a  a  a  a  a...a
 * endFeature   45  a  a  a  a  a  a...a</pre>
 * 
 * - viterbi_r table
 * is related to specific tokens. It encodes the single state features,eg., worldFeature, RegexFeature
 * for all tokens. The r table is represented in the following way.
 * <pre>
 *        0  1  2  3  4...44
 * token1 a  a  a  a  a...a
 * token2 a  a  a  a  a...a</pre>
 *
 * @param segmenttbl Name of table containing all the testing sentences.
 * @param dictionary Name of table containing the dictionary.
 * @param labeltbl Name of table containing the the label space used in POS or other NLP tasks.
 * @param regextbl Name of table containing all the regular expressions to capture regex features.
 * @param viterbi_mtbl Name of table to store the m factors.
 * @param viterbi_rtbl Name of table to store the r factors.
 * @param document_id The id of the sentence to be extracted features, -1 means extracting features for all testing sentences.
