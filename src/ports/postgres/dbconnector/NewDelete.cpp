 * @file NewDelete.cpp
 *
 * @brief Global overrides of operator new and operator delete.
 *
 * We override the C++ global memory allocation and deallocation functions. We
 * map them to ultimately use the PostgreSQL memory routines to protect against
 * memory leaks.
 * See header file \c <new> and ยง18.4.1 of the C++ Standard.
 *
 * @note
 *     This is merely a precaution. C++ objects should still be properly
 *     deallocated. We still make the promise to user code that all destructors
 *     will be properly called.
 *
 * @internal
 *     Declaring operator new and delete as inline and making this file a
 *     header file caused crahes when compiled with GCC 4.6. So be careful if
 *     you want to revert the decision to put the global operator new/delete
 *     in its own translation unit.
 *
 *
 * The default behavior of
 *
 * - <tt>void *operator new[](std::size_t inSize) throw (std::bad_alloc)</tt>
 * - <tt>void *operator new[](std::size_t, const std::nothrow_t&) throw()</tt>
 * - <tt>void operator delete[](void *inPtr) throw()</tt>
 * - <tt>void operator delete[](void *inPtr, const std::nothrow_t&) throw()</tt>
 *
 * is to call the non-array variants (18.4.1.2). Hence no need to override.
