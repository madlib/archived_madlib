 * @brief The \ref assoc_rules function computes association rules for a given set of data. The data is assumed to have two dimensions; items (between which we are trying to discover associations), and a transaction id. This tranaction id groups the items by event and could also be a user id, date, etc. depending on the context of the data. This function assumes the data is stored in two columns with one transaction id and one item per row. 

 * @date   June 2011

 * @sa For a brief introduction to the association rules implementation, see the module
 *     description \ref grp_assoc_rules.

@about
This module implements the association rules data mining technique on a transactional data set. Given the names of a table and the columns, minimum support and confidence values, this function generates all single and multidimensional association rules that meet the minimum thresholds.

Association rule mining is a widely used technique for discovering relationships between variables in a large data set (e.g items in a store that are commonly purchased together). The classic market basket analysis example using association rules is the "beer and diapers" rule. According to data mining urban legend, a study of customers' purchase behavior in a supermarket found that men often purchased beer and diapers together. After making this discovery, the managers strategically placed beer and diapers closer together on the shelves and saw a dramatic increase in sales. In addition to market basket analysis, association rules are also used in bioinformatics, web analytics, and several other fields.  

This type of data mining algorithm uses transactional data. Every transaction event has a unique identification, and each transaction consists of a set of items (or itemset). Purchases are considered binary (either it was purchased or not), and this implementation does not take into consideration the quantity of each item. For the MADlib association rules function, it is assumed that the data is stored in two columns with one item and transaction id per row. Transactions with multiple items will span multiple rows with one row per item.

\b Rules  

Association rules take the form "If X, then Y", where X and Y are non-empty itemsets. X and Y are called the antecedent and consequent, or the left-hand-side and right-hand-side, of the rule respectively. Using our previous example, the association rule may state "If {diapers}, then {beer}" with .2 support and .85 confidence. 

Given any association rule "If X, then Y", the association rules function will also calculate the following metrics: 
- Support: The ratio of transactions that contain X to all transactions, T
\f[
S (X) = \frac{Total X}{Total transactions}
\f]

- Confidence: The ratio of transactions that contain \f$ X,Y \f$ to transactions that contain \f$ X \f$. One could view this metric as the conditional probability of \f$ Y \f$ , given \f$ X \f$ . \f$ P(Y|X) \f$

\f[
C (X \Rightarrow Y) = \frac{s(X \cap Y )}{s(X)} 
\f]

- Lift: The ratio of observed support of \f$ X,Y \f$  to the expected support of \f$ X,Y \f$ , assuming \f$ X \f$ and \f$ Y \f$ are independent.  
\f[
L (X \Rightarrow Y) = \frac{s(X \cap Y )}{s(X) \cdot s(Y)}
\f]

- Conviction: The ratio of expected support of \f$ X \f$  occurring without\f$ Y \f$  assuming \f$ X \f$  and \f$ \neg Y \f$  are independent, to the observed support of \f$ X \f$ occuring without \f$ Y \f$. If conviction is greater than 1, then this metric shows that incorrect predictions ( \f$ X \Rightarrow Y \f$ ) occur less often than if these two actions were independent. This metric can be viewed as the ratio that the association rule would be incorrect if the actions were independent (i.e. a conviction of 1.5 indicates that if the variables were independent, this rule would be incorrect 50% more often.)  

\f[
Conv (X \Rightarrow Y) = \frac{1 - S(Y)}{1 - C(X \Rightarrow Y)}
\f]


\b Apriori  \b algorithm  

Although there are many algorithms that generate association rules, the classic algorithm used is called Apriori (which we implemented in this module). It is a breadth-first search, as opposed to depth-first searches like eclat. Frequent itemsets of order \f$ n \f$ are generated from sets of order \f$ n - 1 \f$. Using the downward closure property, all sets must have frequent subsets. There are two steps in this algorithm; generating frequent itemsets, and using these itemsets to construct the association rules. A simplified version of the algorithm is as follows, and assumes a minimum level of support and confidence is provided: 

\e Initial \e step
-# Generate all itemsets of order 1 
-# Eliminate itemsets that have support is less than minimum support 
 
\e Main \e algorithm  
-# For \f$ n \ge 2 \f$, generate itemsets of order \f$ n \f$ by combining the itemsets of order \f$ n - 1 \f$. This is done by doing the union of two itemsets that have identical items except one. 
-# Eliminate itemsets that have (n-1) order subsets with insufficient support 	
-# Eliminate itemsets with insufficient support 
-# Repeat until itemsets cannot be generated 

\e Association \e rule \e generation

Given a frequent itemset \f$ A \f$ generated from the Apriori algorithm, and all subsets \f$ B \f$ , we generate rules such that \f$ B \Rightarrow (A - B) \f$ meets minimum confidence requirements. 

@input

The input data is expected to be of the following form:
<pre>{TABLE|VIEW} <em>input_table</em> (    
    <em>trans_id</em> INTEGER,
    <em>product</em> TEXT
)</pre>

The algorithm will map the product names to consective integer ids starting at 1. If they are already structured this way, then the ids will not change. 

@usage
- Association rules can be called by:
  <pre>SELECT \ref assoc_rules(
    <em>i_support</em>, <em>i_confidence</em>,'<em>id_col</em>','<em>product_col</em>',
    '<em>input_table</em>','<em>output_schema</em>', <em> p_verbose </em>
    );</pre>
  This will generate all association rules that meet a minimum support of <em>i_support</em> and confidence of <em>i_confidence</em>. 
  
- The results containing the rules, support, confidence, lift, and conviction are stored in the table assoc_rules in the schema specified by <em>output_schema</em>.
<pre>
	 Table "output_schema.assoc_rules"
       Column   |       Type       | Modifiers 
    ------------+------------------+-----------
     ruleid     | integer          |

     confidence | double precision | 
     lift       | double precision | 
     conviction | double precision | 
    Distributed by: (ruleid)

</pre>
	\c pre and \c post are the itemsets of left and right hand sides of the association rule respectively. The \c support, \c confidence, \c lift, and \c conviction columns are calculated as mentioned in the about section. 

@implementation

All the underlying tables created by this function are temporary tables. Please make a copy of any tables that have information you would like to persist (e.g. assoc_prod_uniq) 

The association rules function will always create a table named assoc_rules. Please make a copy of this table before running the function again if you would like to keep multiple association rule tables. 



@examp

Let us take a look at some sample transactional data and generate association rules: 

\code 
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS test_data; 
CREATE TABLE test_data (
	trans_id INT
	, product text
); 

INSERT INTO test_data VALUES (1, 'beer'); 
INSERT INTO test_data VALUES (1, 'diapers'); 
INSERT INTO test_data VALUES (1, 'chips'); 
INSERT INTO test_data VALUES (2, 'beer'); 
INSERT INTO test_data VALUES (2, 'diapers'); 
INSERT INTO test_data VALUES (3, 'beer'); 
INSERT INTO test_data VALUES (3, 'diapers');
INSERT INTO test_data VALUES (4, 'beer'); 
INSERT INTO test_data VALUES (4, 'chips'); 
INSERT INTO test_data VALUES (5, 'beer');
INSERT INTO test_data VALUES (6, 'beer'); 
INSERT INTO test_data VALUES (6, 'diapers'); 
INSERT INTO test_data VALUES (6, 'chips'); 
INSERT INTO test_data VALUES (7, 'beer'); 
INSERT INTO test_data VALUES (7, 'diapers'); 

\endcode 

Let \f$ min(support) = .25 \f$ and \f$ min(confidence) = .5 \f$, and the output schema be 'myschema'. For this example, we will set p_verbose to 'true' so that we have some insight into the progress of the function. We can now generate association rules as follows: 

\code 

SELECT * FROM MADLIB_SCHEMA.assoc_rules (.25, .5, 'trans_id', 'product', 'test_data','myschema', true);

\endcode 

This should generate this output:

\endcode 

The table assoc_prod_uniq is a temporary table generated by the function to map all names of the items into integers. 

\code 
select * from assoc_prod_uniq order by 1;
