-- We use the chi-squared goodness-of-fit test for evidence that
-- weighted_sample() samples according to the distribution defined by the
-- weights. Under the null hypothesis that this be true, we require that the
-- probability of seeing a chi-squared statistic at least as extreme as the
-- one observed is at least 1e-5.
-- Hence, assuming weighted_sample() is correct, the following test fails with
-- probability at most 1e-5, i.e., at most once per 10,000 runs.
