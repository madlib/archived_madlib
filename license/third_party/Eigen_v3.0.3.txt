From the Eigen Licensing FAQ (http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Licensing_FAQ):

"Eigen is dual-licensed: at your choice,
either under the LGPL, version 3 or later,
or under the GPL, version 2 or later.
Note that this is an OR, not an AND. You do not need to conform to both licenses, you just pick the one that you prefer."

For MADlib, Eigen is licensed under the LGPL.
