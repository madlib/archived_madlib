MADlib v0.3

Release Date:  2012-Feb-9

* Installer:
    - Single installer package targeting all supported DBMSs per OS (MADLIB-218)

    - Reimplemented as a template library for performance improvements
      (MADLIB-295)
* Decision Trees:
    - Major update
    - Now supports multiple split criteria (information gain, gini, gain ratio)
    - Now supports tree pruning using a validation set to address over fitting
    - Now supports additional functions for tree output
    - Now supports continuous features in addition to categorical features
    - Additional support for handling null values
    - Improved scalability and performance
* k-Means Clustering:
    - Now handles any input that is convertible to SVEC. (MADLIB-42)
    - Multiple distance functions (L1-norm, L2-norm, cosine similarity, Tanimoto
      similarity) (MADLIB-43)
    - Supports multiple seedings methods (kmeans++, random, user-specified list
      of centroids)
    - Replaced goodness of fit with the (simplified) Silhouette coefficient
      (MADLIB-45)
    - New run-time parameters (MADLIB-47)
* Linear Regression:
    - Major speed improvement
* Logistic Regression:
    - Major speed improvement

      for scoring logistic regression (MADLIB-271)
    - A third optimizer: Incremental-gradient-descent (MADLIB-303)
* Support:
    - For Greenplum <= 4.2.0, added a workaround for INSERT INTO in the same way
      as the existing CREATE TABLE AS workaround. This workaround is not needed
      in Greenplum >= 4.2.1 any more. (MADLIB-265)
    - Function version() returns Madlib build information (MADLIB-309)

Bug fixes:
* Sparse vectors:
    - Fixed sparse-vector type case problems (MADLIB-282, MADLIB-305)

      contain NaN. (MADLIB-364)
    - Association Rules require the madlib schema to be in the search path
      (MADLIB-353)
    - Invalid arguments are not always guaranteed to be handled gracefully and
      may lead to confusing error messages (MADLIB-28, 336, 359, 361, 363, 364)
