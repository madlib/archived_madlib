MADlib v1.0

Release Date: 2013-July-03

New Features:
* Cox Proportional Hazards:
    - Added Right Censoring support for Cox Prop Hazards
* Robust Variance Tests - Huber White:
    - Added a method of calculating robust variance statistic by utilizing the
    Huber-White sandwich estimator for linear regression, logistic regression,
    and multinomial logistic regression
    - Robust variance for linear and logistic regression also includes
    grouping support
* Clustered Sandwich Estimators:
    - Added clustered robust variance statistic by utilizing a clustered sandwich
    estimator for linear regression, logistic regression, and multinomial
    logistic regression
    - Grouping is currently not implemented for clustered and parameter is only
    a placeholder at present
* Marginal Effects Estimator:
    - Added a method for computing the marginal effects for logistic regression
    and multinomial logistic regression
    - Grouping is currently not implemented for marginal effects and the
    parameter is only a placeholder at present
* Multinomial logistic regression:
    - Added a parameter in multinomial logistic regression, to enable picking
    the reference category. Input for number of categories has been removed
    due to redundancy
* Linear regression:
    - Updated grouping columns to input as a comma delimited string rather
    than as an array
    - Resolved an issue with highly collinear data to produce results consistent
    with other statistical packages. Threshold on condition number to use an
    approximation for computing the pseudo-inverse was increased.
* Logistic regression:
    - Changed behavior to error-out if the ouput table already exists

Bug fixes:
* Summary:
    - Summary function (when used with quartiles) used high memory when number
    of column is large. This has been fixed by computing quartiles in an
    iterative manner for a fixed number of columns (Pivotal-170)
    - Fixed a problem with incorrect number of rows returned for Summary when
    all values in a column are NULL (Pivotal-171)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MADlib v0.7

Release Date: 2013-May-01

New Features:
* Correlation function:
    - Function to compute Pearson's cross-correlation for numeric columns in a
        relational table
* Upgrade capability:
    - All new versions since v0.7 are installed in a version-specific folder
        (/usr/local/madlib/Versions/)
    - Upgrade from v0.5/v0.6 to v0.7 on the database is now supported without
        uninstalling previous MADlib database installation.
    - Dependencies on updated functions, types, and other operators are caught
        and upgrade is aborted with an appropriate message

Bug fixes:
* Linear Regression:
    - Improved matrix inversion method to compute coefficients comparable to R
        for regression problems with high multicollinearity (MADLIB-790)
* Logistic Regression:
    - Fixed a problem in logistic regression with grouping on 'text' datatype
        columns  (MADLIB-791)

Known issues:
* Upgrade:
    - Views dependent on MADlib functions being updated will be dropped during
        the upgrade and restored after finishing upgrade. If upgrade fails for
        any reason, these views and the original MADlib schema will *not* be
        restored. Before initiating upgrade, we recommend taking a backup of
        the MADlib schema and move all views dependent on MADlib to separate
        schema and perform a backup with:
                pg_dump -n 'schema_name'

    - Upgrade is currently not supported for the PostgreSQL platform and will
        abort with an error

    - Upgrade currently does not detect functions defined by the user that
        depend upon MADlib functions. Semantic/API changes to these MADlib
        functions could lead to undefined results in such user-defined functions

    - Some important changes for the upgrade from v0.5 to v0.7 are given below
        (Upgrade will raise an error and abort if there exist user-defined views
        that depend on these changes. User-defined functions are not validated
        with this check. An aborted upgrade does not affect the installed version
        of MADlib.)
            -- Logistic regression renamed from 'logregr' to 'logregr_train'
            -- All internal and external aggregates in logistic regression
                have been updated
            -- PLDA module replaced with a refactored LDA module. Due to the
                renaming all functions using PLDA need to be updated
            -- Updated MADlib types:
                    logregr_result, plda_topics_t, plda_word_distrn,
                    plda_word_weight
